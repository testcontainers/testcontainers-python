Ask your question here

**Where are you trying to do it?**

Provide a self-contained code snippet that illustrates the bug or unexpected behavior.
Ideally, include a link to a public repository with a minimal project where someone from the
testcontainers-python can submit a PR with a solution to the problem you are facing with the library.

**Runtime environment**

Provide a summary of your runtime environment. Which operating system, python version, and docker version are you using? What is the version of `testcontainers-python` you are using? You can run the following commands to get the relevant information.

```bash
# Get the operating system information (on a unix os).
$ uname -a
# Get the python version.
$ python --version
# Get the docker version and other docker information.
$ docker info
# Get all python packages.
$ pip freeze
```
